Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Problem Summary:
1. Area Formula:
 area = distance between pillars Ã— min(height1, height2)
2. Key Points for Maximum Area:
 - Longer distance between pillars is better
 - Higher pillars are better
 - The shorter pillar determines the water height
