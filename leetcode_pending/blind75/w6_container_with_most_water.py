Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

Time Complexity: -
Space Complexity: -

Problem Summary:
1. Area Formula:
  area = distance between pillars Ã— min(height1, height2)

2. Key Points for Maximum Area:
  - Longer distance between pillars is better
  - Higher pillars are better
  - The shorter pillar determines the water height
