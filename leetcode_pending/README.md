# LeetCode Pending Problems Repository

This repository contains LeetCode problems that I couldn't solve during the Dale Study weekly sessions. I keep track of these problems here to revisit and solve them later, improving my problem-solving skills systematically.

## About Dale Study
- Weekly LeetCode problem solving study group
- Focus on Blind 75 questions set
- Problems that I couldn't complete during the study sessions are stored here for future practice

## Personal Study Tips ðŸ’¡
* Schedule regular review sessions for pending problems
* Document why I couldn't solve it during the study:
  * Time constraint?
  * Unfamiliar pattern?
  * Need to study prerequisite concepts?
* Try to solve for 30 mins before looking at solutions
* Take notes on patterns and approaches discussed in Dale Study sessions
* Review solutions from study mates - they might have different approaches
