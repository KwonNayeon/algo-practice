# Algorithm Practice Repository

Personal repository for algorithm problem solving practice and technical interview preparation 🎯

## About
This repository contains my solutions and study materials as I learn algorithms and data structures through various resources. The primary language used is Python.

## Current Focus
🎯 **Algorithm & Data Structures Learning**
* Primary Resource: "The Self-Taught Computer Scientist: The Beginner's Guide to Data Structures & Algorithms" (나의 첫 알고리즘+자료구조 with 파이썬) by Cory Althoff
* Additional Areas: CodeIt Python Programming Fundamentals, LeetCode problem solving

✨ **Currently Studying**
* CodeIt: Python Programming Fundamentals - Practice Exercises
* LeetCode Study Problems
* Data Structure Implementation
